# CopyQueue
<b>Allows for a linkedList/Queue type of structure for copying and pasting consecutively without having to switch between pages</b>

I have no idea how to have windows not assume my code is a virus. So you'll have to open the downloaded file in your browser and extract all and then run it. If anyone knows of any tips for my to distribute the program for free, let me know

To use, run the application, and start to ctrl+c consecutively until you want to paste stuff. When it is time, you can ctrl+v to paste the stuff in order
other controls:
End Program : ctrl + esc
Pause (run in normal mode) = ctrl+b    Note: You must press ctrl+b again to unpause
Navigate through queue = ctrl+rightarrow or ctrl+leftarrow
